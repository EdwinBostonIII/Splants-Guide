## 5. IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP (SECTION 16 SNAPSHOT)

**Immediate Actions (This Week):**
1. Review the three master documents, align on outline and ownership.
2. Audit `Splants_Guide_FINAL.txt` plus supporting drafts for reusable content.
3. Stand up formatting enforcement (read `STYLE_AND_FORMATTING_GUIDE.txt`, configure `format_cleaner.py`, schedule manual reviews).

**Week 1:** Consolidate Parts 0-2, finish Part 2 subsections, seed appendices. Deliver 45,000+ clean words.

**Weeks 2-3:** Write Parts 3-5 plus decision matrices and dashboards. Deliver ~30,000 words.

**Weeks 4-5:** Write Parts 6-8, integrate production callouts, stress redundancy narratives. Deliver ~30,000 words.

**Week 6:** Complete appendices (A-M), integrate diagrams, finish templates, add remaining war stories. Deliver ~15,000 words.

**Week 7:** Quality assurance cycle: proof, verify calculations, run tests, validate links, enforce accessibility and localization.

**Week 8:** Final polish: master index, quick reference cards, release checklist, success verification.

Effort guideline (from Section 17): ~115-120 focused hours with tooling, reviews, and polish.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

## 6. WORKING RHYTHMS AND CHECKLIST PHASES

Reference `INTEGRATION_CHECKLIST.md` for daily tracking. Core phases:
1. Formatting and Style: Remove em-dashes, body hyphens, enforce section framing, add validation checkpoints.
2. Part 2 Completion: Finish Sections 2.2 through 2.7 with blueprint structure plus error catalog, Discord alert templates.
3. Parts 3-5 Expansion: Analytics infrastructure, automated decisions, optimization systems, customer communications.
4. Parts 6-7 Expansion: Observability, incident response, scaling triggers, cost optimization, team growth.
5. Content Elements and Appendices: Templates, war stories, diagram insertion, service comparison encyclopedia, calculation appendix, troubleshooting encyclopedia.
6. Polish and Enhancements: Progress indicators, cost trackers, time reality boxes, QA sweeps, release prep.

Use section checklists to log validation checkpoints, debugging guidance, and time estimates for remediation.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

## 7. FORMATTING, VISUAL, AND TONE STANDARDS

- No em-dashes or body-text hyphens. Use colons, commas, periods, or parentheses instead. Hyphens remain valid for compound words, ranges, URLs, file paths, and ASCII diagrams.
- Every major section opens with quick jump navigation, time reality box, overview, and success metrics.
- Body structure: Why it matters, implementation steps with timed estimates, validation checkpoint, testing procedure, Production Reality box.
- Section closing: milestone celebration, capability summary, problems prevented, next steps, confidence checklist.
- Diagram cadence: at least one per major section plus targeted diagrams when text would take multiple paragraphs.
- Visual flourishes: critical boxes, warnings, production reality, progress bars, decision matrices from `ASCII_DIAGRAMS_LIBRARY.txt`.
- Tone: Experienced architect, metric-heavy, candid about risks, precise instructions, no vague guidance.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

## 8. LIBRARIES, STORIES, AND TEMPLATE EXPECTATIONS

- **Part 2 Expansion Template:** Apply structure across Parts 2-7. Maintain word count targets (6,000 to 8,500 per major section) and integrate ASCII visuals.
- **ASCII Diagram Library:** Copy the eight provided diagrams and reuse the fifteen flourish templates. Customize captions and metrics for each placement.
- **War Stories:** Two fully written incidents plus eight structured templates. Target 1,000 to 1,500 words per remaining story with investigation, impact, fix, prevention, and ROI data.
- **Template Library (Appendix E):** 15+ email templates, 20+ customer service responses, 10+ status page updates, plus webhook alert scripts.
- **Service Comparison Encyclopedia:** Cover orchestration platforms, manufacturing providers, databases, email systems, monitoring suites with quantified tradeoffs.
- **Calculation Appendix:** ROI formulas, per-order cost models, scaling breakpoints, volume discount tables, international shipping math.
- **Troubleshooting Encyclopedia:** 50+ common errors with trigger, detection signal, affected systems, recovery path, prevention.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

## 9. TOOLING AND AUTOMATION

**Formatting Enforcement (`format_cleaner.py`):**
```bash
python format_cleaner.py Splants_Guide_FINAL.txt Splants_Guide_FINAL.cleaned.txt
```
Review analysis counts, inspect the cleaned file, then merge changes manually so precision is maintained.

**Recommended Workflow:**
- Run the cleaner on any section before merging.
- Maintain a running spreadsheet or tracker mirroring `INTEGRATION_CHECKLIST.md` statuses.
- Use Git branches per part to isolate rewrites and maintain review history.
- Add manual lint steps: search for " — ", the literal space-hyphen-space pattern, and other violations before marking sections complete.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

## 10. QUALITY ASSURANCE AND EVALUATION

- Apply the weighted rubric from `evaluation_framework.md` (Technical Accuracy 25%, Completeness 20%, Practical Utility 20%, Clarity 15%, Learning Progression 10%, Motivation 10%).
- Use persona-driven scenarios from `evaluation_test_scenarios.md` to validate that readers can execute payment capture, Make.com automation, provider integrations, incident recovery.
- Run `evaluation_quickstart.md` after each major section to confirm prerequisites, walkthrough steps, validation points, and troubleshooting coverage.
- QA Week (Section 16.2): Proofreading, calculation verification, executable code testing, SQL validation, link checking, accessibility review, localization checks.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

## 11. VERIFICATION AND SUCCESS CRITERIA

Completion looks like:
- Parts 0-8 fully authored with production-ready instructions.
- Appendices A-M complete (glossary, resource directory, code library, calculations, templates, troubleshooting, war stories).
- Quantitative targets met or exceeded (callouts, errors, matrices, code, SQL, configurations, troubleshooting scenarios).
- ASCII diagrams integrated and captioned across the guide.
- Testing protocols documented and validated for every critical workflow (webhooks, fulfillment, failover, monitoring, scaling, security).
- `INTEGRATION_COMPLETE_VERIFICATION.txt` updated to reflect final review plus release readiness.
- Readers can implement, operate, scale, and recover without external research.

Use the success checklist in Section 15 of `MASTER_INTEGRATION_SPECIFICATION.md` before shipping.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

## 12. NEXT STEPS

1. Confirm ownership of each remaining section plus supporting content categories.
2. Duplicate `PART_2_EXPANSION_TEMPLATE.txt` structure into the next section you are authoring, injecting diagram references and validation checkpoints immediately.
3. Schedule weekly reviews keyed to the roadmap, ensuring each deliverable passes formatting, QA, and evaluation gates before moving on.
4. Keep this master guide open alongside the `INTEGRATION_INDEX.md` tracker so scope, requirements, and verification stay aligned.

You now have a single reference that combines orientation, requirements, execution sequencing, tooling, and quality criteria. Use it to keep every contributor synchronized while you push the Splants Guide to its 120,000+ word, production-grade finish line.
