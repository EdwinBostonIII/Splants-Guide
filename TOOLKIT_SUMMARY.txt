QUESTIONS TO ASK YOURSELF

Before starting each section:

□ Have I reviewed the template structure?
□ Do I know which diagrams to include?
□ Do I understand the time reality for this topic?
□ What are the common production failures here?
□ What 5-dimension decisions need explanation?

While writing each section:

□ Am I using specific numbers (not vague terms)?
□ Have I included cost and time estimates?
□ Did I add validation checkpoints after steps?
□ Are production failures documented with rates?
□ Do diagrams clarify complex concepts?

After completing each section:

□ Did I run format_cleaner.py?
□ Does it pass the quality checklist?
□ Are all visual elements properly formatted?
□ Did I add the milestone celebration box?
□ Is it 6,000 to 8,500 words (target length)?

YOUR PATH FORWARD

You now have everything needed to complete the Splants Guide expansion:

  Templates → Show you HOW to write
  Library → Gives you WHAT to include
  Checklist → Tells you WHERE you are
  Progress Report → Shows you the BIG PICTURE
  Style Guide → Keeps you CONSISTENT
  War Stories → Provide REAL EXAMPLES
  Format Tool → Ensures COMPLIANCE

The work ahead is substantial (99-122 hours) but completely defined. Follow
the templates, reference the style guide, use the visual library, track with
the checklist, and you will systematically create a comprehensive, professional,
production-ready guide that exceeds 100,000 words.

Start with Section 2.2. The template shows you exactly what to do.
