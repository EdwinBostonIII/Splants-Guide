## FORMATTING STANDARDS TO APPLY

### Critical Rules (MUST FIX)
- [ ] Remove all em-dashes (—) from body text
  - Replace with colon (:) for explanations
  - Replace with comma (,) for continuations
  - Replace with parentheses () for asides
  - Replace with period (.) for emphasis

- [ ] Remove standalone hyphens (-) from body text
  - Keep in compound words (print-on-demand, real-time)
  - Keep in code blocks
  - Keep in URLs/filenames
  - Keep in ASCII diagrams

- [ ] Add metrics to all quantitative statements
  - No "fast" → "1.2 seconds P50 latency"
  - No "reliable" → "99.7% uptime SLA"
  - No "expensive" → "$0.31 per transaction"
  - No "high volume" → "1,000+ orders/day"

### Code Block Standard
Every code block MUST include:
```
/**
 * Language: [identifier]
 * Version: [version tested]
 * Last Verified: [exact date]
 * Dependencies: [list with versions]
 * Purpose: [what this does]
 * Expected Input: [data structure]
